# Moodle (unofficial) Certifaction plugin #

Make your documents tamper-proof on the blockchain.

The plugin is actually a simple PoC which sends PDF submissions in assignments to the Certifaction API. Right now deletions of submissions in Moodle assignments are not observed by the plugin. Only submitted data will be processed.

To make use of this technology on production, you must have a paid subscription plan on [Certifaction.io](https://certifaction.io).

**Note**: For testing purposes you can install the plugin and make use of the `GÃ¶rli Testnet` creating a test account and afterwards an `API key` on https://app.testnet.certifaction.io.
